## Loose thoughts 

I don't know how this is controversial, but standing with Ukraine as the eu/usa meant it to be is stupid.

The borders are irrelevant for dead Ukrainians.

Stand with Ukraine should mean stop sending  Ukrainians to die.

Make peace with Russia and the Russian population. Forgive the debt and help reconstruction.

Stand with Ukraine mustn't be, sell them debt an kill their people to them buy their land. Ukrainians aren't slaves to produce your cheap food and rare minerals, they are people!

## Notes

This is one of those that needs to be revisited...
Please disagree, and politely, tell me about it.
