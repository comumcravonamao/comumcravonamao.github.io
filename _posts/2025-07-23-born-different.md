You (probably) are wrong!<br>
My bold claim of the day... lets see who gets there first.<br>
This isn't a coming out confession. But feels just the same.<br>
I've never fitted in. Not quite fully.<br>
The weird kid that was bullied because, understanding how wrong it was, refused to harass others. The weird kid, happy to spend the summer vacation building a cabin in the woods. Happy to learn in class and full-heatedly believing that knowledge should be shared.<br>
By now you might be right, and getting the picture. But I wasn't, not yet. Our western culture does not allow for our full expression and growth, so it took me  a long time to learn.<br>
It took 30 years to stumble onto the over 100 years old culture that I've came to connect to.<br>
Yes anarchist (real diverse, honest and prolific) literature finally provided me the tools to describe the world around me. Because knowing the world, having a model to help you read reality is how you find “you”.<br>
As confessions go, I cannot see my self as an anarchist. For starters I known very little, and worse I practice very little. And if you haven't read any anarchist literature the one takeaway you need to know is anarchist theory means practice!<br>
You can, and should, read and write all the philosophy and political analysis your heart desires. But anarchists thrive in practice.<br>
(Going on a tangent) Why are anarchists disobedient "trouble makers"? Practice.  The big reason it's worth your time to know about it (anarchist theory) lies in using it to do something about your surroundings. In there leis the tools for peace, cooperation and real significant change.<br>
Where were we?<br>
Oh yes, a call to action.<br>
You dear reader, if your empathy brought you thus far, you might not know it, but you already agree with 70% of what you'll read. The remaining 30% will then be easy to follow.<br>
So read! (It's free)<br>
Talk to others!<br>
And let roll the new roller-coaster that will be the world<br>
