# Welcome

This is the place to find opinions and analyses of the country and the world.

Here we appeal to diversity and ideas, defending the resolution of conflicts and the advancement of societies through words, understanding, solidarity, satire and even poetry.

It is a journey of discovery. It's about philosophy and personal growth that we should all share.

Viva A Liberdade!

# Objectives

This is a project that fights for humanism, honesty and social justice and that focuses on political society and the economy.

It is openly in favor of transparent journalism with its views and ideologies clearly discriminated; as well as in favor of independent journalism without geopolitical borders.

It is also openly against the oppression of peoples in its different forms, in particular against war.

Lets see where it takes us.

# House Rules

1. Be civilized;
- Whether you agree or not, read, comment where relevant, but repeat the opinions of others;
2. Facts have references;
3. Opinions are in <span style="color:Platinum">gray</span>;
4. Quotes are in <span style="color:Seashell;font-style:italic;">white</span>;

## Muses

Many of the articles have sources of inspiration. I am in the references or embedded (in the case of songs).
