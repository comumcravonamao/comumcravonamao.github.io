<div style="color:Platinum">
As boiling pot, no control,<br>
like a red flame you raged<br>
As shatter pieces your soul<br>
dark, torn, caged<br>
<br>
But before forgetting your once goal<br>
your white flag with those colors dye<br>
With hope we march as a whole<br>
for the dream we shall never let die!<br>
</div>
