# Prelude

This text is the result of my interpretation of some texts (listed below) on alienation, and related concepts such as anomie.
The ideas here presented aren't a comprehensive essay on the subject of alienation, and much of literature on the subject wasn't considered.
This text represents my interpretation, my framework to understand this feeling.
Left, for obvious reasons, out of this analysis is alienation in its political/ economical interpretation as "the transfer of property ownership".

## One more note

A disclaimer is in order. I'm not an anthropologist, nor a sociologists, neither am I a philosopher or a physiologist. I'm a person, for lack of a better descriptor, I'm a not so well read dude. But I have opinions.
Hope this text is of use to advance the understanding of our society, my own and maybe yours; and, this text (well not the text, but it's author) expects it to be discussed, contested and revisited.

# Introduction

The analysis here presented attempts to create a framework capable to understand alienation (and related concepts) not strictly as put forward in Marxist thought (as material analysis arrown production), but as the  consequences on the human experiencing it. It tries to abstract from the more specific forms of alienation presented by Marx and others and view it as broader phenomenon.
In this framework, for example, the two (individual and social) strains describe by David Graeber aren't two separate ways of explaining alienation, but are both pointing in the same direction. Moreover in this analysis the concepts of anomie and alienation are used somewhat interchangeably. This not by mistake as for the purposes of this framework they are both the result of the same set of human and social circumstances. There is chapter dedicated to the subject at the end.

## Introductory quotes

For those who might not have read the papers listed here's some bait.

**Alienation**

"The notion of alienation is a very unusual one because it is at once an attempt to explain a widespread feeling—a very subjective, somewhat indefinable feeling—and a critique of the nature of any society that regularly produces it." [1]

"In sociology, alienation is when humans feel disconnected or estranged from some part of their nature or from society." [2]

**Anomie**

"[...] a state of normlessness, disorder, or confusion in a society when the standard norms and values are weak or unclear." [3]

# Alienation an analysis of cause and the self

As complexity grows, both in the societal system and tools (both the governing systems and the gadgets, cars, etc... with an ever increasing number of rules and technology) so does the inability of the human intellect to keep track of the whole.
Unable to keep a full picture at any given time  one is then made to abstract concepts and deal with these in isolation, accepting that they'll interface with all other conceptions of reality one holds. On its own this shouldn't be a problem as it ensures that one is able to function. Alienation would then be the breaking of the chains (relations) between concepts, in other words, one is or feels alienated from what one is incapable of creating a web of relationships around.
Formally, these thoughts can be stated as: Alienation is felt when there isn't a chain (logical reasoning or emotional) connecting them from action over a concept through the self to the consequence over the same or other concepts.

## Personal realization and Production (at work) 

At an individual level, one shall feel alienated when they can't reason or feel a continuous string of relationships between their surroundings.
Some examples could be:

- due to a lack of empathy felt from/towards the neighbors, or the place one lives in. Given that no meaningful interpersonal or environmental relations were ever established, there can be no association between the littering/cleaning a comum space and the consequences of such actions on the neighbors, social order, ecology, etc... Although all concepts of the chain are known : the neighborhood, the ecology, littering and the self there would be no chain (logical reasoning or emotional) connecting them from action through the self to consequence.
- For a worker producing anything they themselves do not own, they'll experience alienation if the consequences of the work they perform are not reachable. If one produces a good (t-shirts for example) and has no way of influencing their work decision and cannot share any benefit of the end use of the good (cannot suggest: a better manufacturing process, or a better t-shirt model; and never shares the end user joy of wearing said t-shirt, nor even knows if it will ever be worn), regardless of any productivity bonus, they'll fell alienation. There is no emotion or rational linking the production, the self as the acting party and the overachieving goal of producing the shirt in the first place.

To this second example three thoughts come to mind. Firstly this is obviously present as result of capitalism, as the production of goods is often (almost exclusively) done to turn a profit for the owner, and the worker is hired, not to create profits (much less share them), but to produce something that the owner will then turn into its own profit; this way ensuring that the worker can hardly create a meaningful chain for itself.
Secondly, most laborers now a days don't/can't produce a good from start to finish, most often take part on a small and repetitive task that can even yield multiple goods down the line, a result which they have no agency over.
Thirdly the relationship between alienation and burnout is here made obvious when considering that the human being is specially adept at creating patterns and searching for meaning. Once no chains can be meaningfully created for the subject despite performing the action over and over, often without any joy, the mind can only panic, not being able to rationalize world around.

### Workers as assets (objects of the company)

"They are essentially converted into objects by the production method, meaning they are viewed and treated not as humans but as replaceable elements of a system."[2]

Although this framework does not consider the class conscience as a main worry, nor does it see it as static problem between two factions, it's foundations are understood and it (this mode of thinking) can, by other means, arrive at a similar conclusion.
Using this framework the main issue is not the lack of class consciousness, but the lack of solidarity between all humans. (the next section expands a little on this)

### Other considerations for the individual

The examples described on this chapter can also be viewed or complemented with the lack of an overarching goal in life, a reason to be.
This is a problem created by "society" and can be explained by anomie. This is often addressed by religion and often "solved" by it.
When two (or more) factions with an imbalance of power create a ruler and ruled dynamic, where the ruled do not, or cannot believe or reason like the ruler, alienation is bound to show up.

## In society

Social alienation can be reason in the same manner. Even knowing and being able to conceptualize the laws and values of a society, one will feel alienated if the inputs from the society one can act upon produce no meaningful results to oneself.
Some simple examples could be:
voting where no political party serves ones interests, or even if their campaigns say so it is never fulfilled
Being mistreat by authorities despite never having there been a logic cause for that (racism comes to mind as the self suffers a cause to with the self cannot connect to any of its actions). Or even having their livelihood threatened by unequal distribution of the basic amenities an social services and access to goods.

## In theology

The theological alienation is easier to reason about. If one's idea of self and conception to the universe is given by the presence of any theological entity, any deviation, any alternative explanation of the universe will be at odds with the conceptual relations one knows. One is in this sense alienated by one's own beliefs. (related in a way to alienation caused by ignorance)

# Missing from this analysis

This chapter concernes open questions and topics not addressed by the preceding body of text.

## Anomie and alienation

"Alienation occurs when an individual feels disconnected from their work or surroundings. Anomie occurs when there is a lack of shared values and norms in society." [2]

## Alienation by ignorance

Our intellectual limitations can, by the presented framework, make one fall into a state of alienation. This seems at first to be a trivial matter. But should that be true, wouldn’t every one feel alienated all that time, indeed no one is capable of knowing it all, to connect all the dots.
 
These thoughts will not be expanded upon on this article. The chapters “Purposeful Ignorance” and “Ignorance by information” do expand a little on this. 

## Purposeful ignorance

Sometimes one does not know, not because one is not capable of if, neither intellectually nor physically (the information is freely available on the news, internet, libraries, etc..), but because one chooses to.
Should / can this cause the feeling of alienation?

Is “Ignorance bliss”?

## Ignorance "by information" 

Given the current media landscape one is now drowning in information. As a complement to the previews chapter, this overwhelming stream of information can be one of the causes of alienation.

As it is a known fact more information isn’t necessarily better information. The increasing amount of both untruthful information; and doubt surrounding intentions behind the sources can create a nihilistic reaction towards “Truth”.
Facing such scenario one can be lead to either: choose ignorance, having no interactions to worry about means not chains of reasoning need be affected/created (again, is ignorance bliss?); or, in the other hand, dogmatically select information sources as the full extent of truth providers.

Both cases attempt to avoid alienation. And [both options] avoid the third and difficult option of battling countless and frustrating validations and second guessing. this last can it self alienate.

# Closing thoughts

Viewed from this lens, already described as “Alienation if felt when there isn't a chain (logical reasoning or emotional) connecting them from action over a concept through the self to the consequence over the same or other concepts.” one can reason about and in accordance with the comum interpretations of Alienation while opening the dor to generalizing its application.
Stands out from this analysis, that the feeling of alienation can be mitigated by an increased involvement with ones life.

By:

1- the living place, creating bonds, sharing spaces and values
2- in the production of goods and services, defining goals and methodologies in a cooperative fashion 
3- bringing decisions closer to the affected populations
4- aligning the above points in accordance with society's goals

It would be reasonable to assume that such feelings (and its adverse effects) should be mitigated.
