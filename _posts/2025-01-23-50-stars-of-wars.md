The U.S. Empire, also known as the U.S. and simply as America and later as the old U.S. Empire, was the dictatorship that replaced the U.S.A.'s Republic at the end of the XXI century. 

Though the Empire rose to power by promising to bring order to the planet, it oversaw a period of harsh military rule and aggressive expansion.

The USA is:
 - still trying to expand
 - controlling the EU
 - using its influence to distort the "rules based politics" in its favor
 - waging wars to feed the ever demanding need for the growth of capital
 - destroying the land of those who stand on its way, and dare to think different
