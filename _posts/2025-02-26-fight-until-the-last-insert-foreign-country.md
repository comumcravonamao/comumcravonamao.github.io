# Fight until the last man

A short analysis of one of techniques used to control (and dare I say destroy) other nations:

1. Create a war
2. Make then fight until
3. Profit from the resulting caos

Much more can and should be said, but two examples come to mind.

**Cambodia**

On the last days of the Lon Nol regime the USA ambassador on said to a reporter "you guys thing you know everything, but I've got order to fight until the last Cambodian".[¹]

**Ukraine**

In Ukraine, the Biden administration is fighting Russia “to the last Ukrainian,” retired senior US diplomat Chas Freeman says.[²]
